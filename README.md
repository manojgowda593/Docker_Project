# Project: Containerization of MERN Application

This repository showcases my project on containerizing a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application using Docker. The project includes:

Designing a custom virtual network for secure container isolation.
Deploying individual containers for the Frontend (React), Backend (Node.js), and Database (MongoDB).
Implementing seamless communication between containers with best practices.
To give you a better idea of the outcomes, I have attached an image that highlights the successful deployment and functionality of the application.
