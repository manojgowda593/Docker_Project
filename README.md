#Project: AWS Cloud Architecture and Infrastructure
This repository contains details about my project, where I designed and deployed a multi-AZ architecture on AWS to ensure high availability and security. The project includes:

Hosting HTML pages on private EC2 instances behind a Bastion host.
Implementing a Load Balancer for auto-scaling and fault tolerance.
Configuring public and private subnets for efficient networking.
Additionally, I have attached an image showcasing the outcomes of the deployed infrastructure to give a visual representation of the results.
